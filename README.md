# Code in Place Final Project

## Project Overview

This project was created by Nigel Pun as part of the Stanford Code in Place Final Project. The project consists of animated characters created using Python, which can be interacted with through various states.

## Features

- **Animated Characters**: Two animated characters with different expressions.
- **Python Script**: The main script (`shimeji_v2.py`) that handles the animations and interactions.
- **Images**: Images used for the animations.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- `shimeji_v2.py`: The main Python script that drives the animations.
- `clicked.png`: Image file for the clicked state of the character.
- `standing.png`: Image file for the standing state of the character.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Any additional libraries required by the script (specified in the script itself)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Note: If there is no `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the libraries specified in the script.

## Usage

Run the main script to start the animation:

    ```sh
    python shimeji_v2.py
    ```
